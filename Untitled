I have always been captivated by computers, and driven to understand them.

After first being exposed to programming in middle school writing
Java Applets as well as games on my TI-84 Calculator, I immediately
fell in love.

I soon realized that programming and computer science were a tangible
extension of my lifelong appreciation for math.  The two go hand in hand --
both give that extreme sense of accomplishment after solving a particularly
challenging problem.  Deciding to major in Computer Science in college
was an obvious choice, and I have never regretted it.

Since then, I have gained experience in a multitude of programming
languages and technologies.  Today, I have the most mastery of C, JavaScript, React.js,
and Ruby on Rails.

One of my favorite personal projects is SoundClone, a full-stack web application
written with a Ruby on Rails back-end, a react/redux front-end, and a PostgreSQL database.
The project successfully emulates the features of popular music platform SoundCloud,
and was designed and implemented in a 10 day timeframe.

I yearn to work in an environment in which challenges are regularly encountered,
and subsequently conquered, with people from which I can learn.
