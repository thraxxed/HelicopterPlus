# Helicopter +
Helicopter Plus is a 2-dimensional sidescrolling game in which the player controls a helicopter, initially in
free-fall, which may only be moved vertically, by pressing the space bar to activate positive upward acceleration.

The player must avoid randomly positioned obstacles and enemies, and may collect items for bonus points, as well as power-ups.
